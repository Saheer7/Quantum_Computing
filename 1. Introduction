Intro:
Quantum Computing is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation.


Computation:
A Physical process which is 1) Finite in time and 2) Fixed set of states

Information:
An Intepretaion of particular systems state. Fixed set of distinguishable states.
